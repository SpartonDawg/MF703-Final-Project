# Market Neutral Commodity Trading Strategy
Group 3: Jack Bartoluzzi, Jim Burrill, Tim Lee, Sagar Mirchandani, Kevin Yang, Hanbo Yu, Hamza Zbiri

[Inspired by the J.P. Morgan Optimax Market-Neutral Index, we set out with the goal of developing an investment strategy that seeks to generate consistent returns through a selection of commodity-linked component sub-indices. This required the identification of a L/S strategy to generate trading signals based on commodity price movements, and a portfolio optimization technique to minimize portfolio beta and variance for the generated trading signals. To validate the identified investment strategy an extensive back test was required.]
